(Hopefully) A Good Beginner's Guide to Formula 1

## 1. Data

### Source
The dataset was obtained from Kaggle (13 tables in total). I did some basic cleaning such as ensuring all data formats are correct, and performed VLOOKUP to replace some columns, which helped me reduce the table count to 11.

### Creating database
To create a database, I needed to make sure how the tables relate to each other. I used drawsql.app to draw a data model.

Using SQL, this model is then imported to local database manager, pgAdmin4.
